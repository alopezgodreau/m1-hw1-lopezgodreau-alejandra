Markup: ##About Me##
    I'm Alejandra Lopez-Godreau, I was born and raised in Puerto Rico, lived in the Dominican Republic, and settled in Miami. I'm a Digital Strategies student, an actress, influencer, and radio host. I love communications and enjoy a challenge, hence why I'm taking this class. I love being on TikTok, hanging out with friends, helping out in the neighborhood, and playing with my dog BonBon.
Markup: ##Past Coding Experience##
    I have zero coding experience, this is my first time downloading any softwares like Visual Studio Code or even opening the terminal on my computer. I'm learning slowly but surely. 
Markup: ##Career Goals##
    I have a lot of ambitions when it comes to my career goals, on one side I'd love to have a constant acting workflow, but alongside, I want to learn all about communications. I see myself opening my own business one day, developing my family's nonprofit organization, Jorge's Treehouse, into a national nonprofit organization, and most of all, just connecting with people. For now, I look forward to understanding the world of coding.
